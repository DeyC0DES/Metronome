# Metronome Project

  Hey!!!! Its me again, yep. So this time to pratice at python and do more projects in the future i did a simple Metronome, to u that likes to pratice with it (who likes it? im joking), sooo that dont have limit to BPM (Beats Per Minute) but if u put high BPM maybe can bug the Metronome, how this works its simple but i will explain about how i did it.

  So, when im at my music class or when im practicing with it, i was think like "how they do it?" so guess what? IM PROGRAMMER!!! I can do it. So i thought like, alright to do it i just need know the BPS (Beats Per Second) and after this calc the **time that pause between one and the another**, like on metronome have 4 time so i needed discover this "sleep time"
then i just calc the BPS using this: **BPS = BPM / 60** and with that i get the BPS and to discover the "sleep time" i did **pause = 1 / BPS** and works well!!! When i thought on this formulas i felt so smart ngl.

  And the last thing, i did everything of this Metronome, include the tick sounds, but if u want to change something like colors or put another sound u will just need to change on the code, its a open code so u can edit it!! Below will have a pic of the Metronome:
